<c><h1>Malware Analysis and Incident Response</h1><c>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
As an entry-level security analyst at Linetrale, I encountered a challenging malware incident early in my cybersecurity career, and this project reflects my dedication to developing practical skills in malware analysis and incident response.

<h2>Project Details:</h2>

1. <h3>Incident Identification:</h3> During my initial months of employment in March 2022, I was in charge of keeping an eye on our network. After reporting strange network activity to my team right away, an inquiry was launched as a result of my observation.

2. <h3>Malware Triage:</h3> It was determined that the unusual activity was malware. Despite this being my first experience with such a threat, I notified the senior analysts and started containment procedures.

3. <h3>Dynamic and Static Analysis:</h3> I examined the malware's code and watched how it behaved in a controlled setting. Though I was somewhat new to this subject, the focus was on discovering its features and methods.

4. <h3>Payload and Command and Control (C2) Analysis:</h3> Understanding the malware's C2 communication and payload was made possible by the analysis. For additional action, this knowledge was essential.

5. <h3>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):</h3> I put a lot of effort into recording IOCs such network signatures, file hashes, and registry modifications. The incident response team found value in this knowledge.

6. <h3>Mitigation and Remediation:</h3> To develop a mitigation plan, the senior analysts and I worked together. This involved patching vulnerabilities and separating impacted systems. At this point, my primary responsibility was assistance.

7. <h3>Post-Incident Analysis:</h3> Following the incident's containment, I reviewed the incident response protocol and assisted in updating the relevant procedures and documentation.

8. <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3> Both I and the rest of the team learned a lot from this episode. We shared our conclusions and learnings during a debriefing session, which enhanced our capacity for quick decisions.


<h2>Results and Impact:</h2>

- Potential data loss and system compromise were avoided by the early notice and reporting of the occurrence.
- My comprehension of security protocols and collaboration enhanced as a result of my involvement in the incident response and analysis process.
- The experience helped raise the organization's general security awareness while laying the groundwork for future skill development.

This assignment shows my capacity to pick things up quickly and adjust as an entry-level security analyst. It demonstrates my dedication to the security industry, even at the start of my career, and how I support the team's goals by carefully completing assignments and actively taking part in the incident response procedure.
