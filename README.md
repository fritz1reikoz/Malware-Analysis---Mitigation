<h1>Malware Analysis and Incident Response</h1>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
In my role as a Security analyst at Linetrale, We once encountered a sophisticated malware incident that threatened our organization's sensitive data and systems. I included to the team in analyzing and mitigating this threat, which showcased my skills in malware analysis and incident response.

<h2>Project Details:</h2>

1. <h3>Incident Identification:</h3> In May 2022, our security monitoring system detected abnormal network behavior and unusual traffic patterns originating from a specific endpoint. Suspecting a potential malware infection, we immediately initiated an investigation.

2. <h3>Malware Triage:</h3> The malware was identified as a zero-day variant of a known Trojan that had not been previously documented. We then isolated the affected system to prevent lateral movement and began an in-depth analysis.

3. <h3>Dynamic and Static Analysis:</h3> We conducted both dynamic and static analysis on the malware. Dynamic analysis involved executing the malware in a controlled environment to monitor its behavior, while static analysis focused on examining the code and its obfuscation techniques.

4. <h3>Payload and Command and Control (C2) Analysis:</h3> The malware's payload was reverse-engineered to understand its capabilities. I identified the C2 server locations and communication protocols used, shedding light on the attacker's objectives.

5. <h3>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):</h3> I meticulously documented IOCs, including file hashes, registry changes, and network signatures, and promptly shared them with our threat intelligence team.

6. <h3>Attribution Analysis:</h3> While challenging, I made significant progress in attributing the malware to a known threat actor group. This information was shared with law enforcement agencies.

7. <h3>Mitigation and Remediation:</h3> Working closely with our IT and security teams, I developed a comprehensive mitigation and remediation plan. This included isolating affected systems, patching vulnerabilities, and improving network segmentation.

8. <h3>Post-Incident Analysis:</h3> After containing the malware, I conducted a thorough post-incident analysis to identify weaknesses in our security posture. This led to recommendations for enhancing our intrusion detection and prevention capabilities.

9. <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3> The incident served as a valuable learning experience for our organization. I coordinated a knowledge-sharing session to ensure that the entire security team benefited from the insights gained during the analysis and response.
